## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:
* [X] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.

The following **optional** features are implemented:
* [X] Custom font

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [X] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!

- A UISwitch for the user in case they need to split the bill

## Notes

Without any swift experience (only a 20-hour introduction class), I had to google and try everything after the video walkthrough.
It took time, but I had learned a lot and had a lot of fun.
I was trying to figure out how to make the shared average amount change while going back to change the tip percentages.
Sadly I couldn't spend more time on this before find out the solution.

The problem that I have is although I managed to figure out a way to make it work, I don't really know the meaning of each code I write.
